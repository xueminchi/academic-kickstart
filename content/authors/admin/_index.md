I am currently a PhD student in Control science and engineering at [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/). I have received Master degree from [Dalian University of Technology](http://www.dlut.edu.cn) in 2019.

I am passion about contributing to a further understanding of algorithms of path planning and following of self-driving cars and control strategies of adaptive and robust control.
